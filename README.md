# libva-v4l2

A VA-API backend for Qualcomm Iris, using the Linux V4L2 stateful M2M interface.
It provides hardware video decoding and H.264/HEVC encoding on **SC8280XP/8cx Gen3**, tested on
**Radxa Dragon Q8B**. The project is experimental and targets this platform;
it is not a generic backend for all V4L2 devices.

## Support

| Codec | Decoding | Encoding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 / AVC | Constrained Baseline, Main, High (8-bit) | Same profiles (8-bit) |
| H.265 / HEVC | Main, Main10 (8/10-bit) | Main (8-bit) |
| VP9 | Profiles 0 and 2 (8/10-bit) | — |

Supported video is progressive 4:2:0. Decoding has been tested with FFmpeg,
GStreamer, mpv, VLC, Chromium, and Kodi; H.264 encoding with FFmpeg, GStreamer,
and Sunshine. HEVC encoding is tested with FFmpeg and GStreamer.

- H.264 and HEVC encoding support CQP, CBR, and VBR, even dimensions from 128×128 to
  3840×2160, and I/P frames with one reference. I-frame requests produce IDR frames; B frames
  are unsupported.
  HEVC encoding currently uses Main tier; Main10 encoding is not implemented.
- Optional FastCV VPP provides CDSP scaling for linear NV12 with DMA-BUF support.
  Widths must be multiples of 16 and heights even. Color/bit-depth conversion
  and other VPP filters are unsupported.
- Compatible DMA-BUF paths avoid raw-frame copies. Applications that cache
  surfaces before decoding use a GPU copy by default.

## Performance

HEVC Main (8-bit) throughput on **Radxa Dragon Q8B — SC8280XP, Iris HFI Gen2**,
using FFmpeg 9.0.1 and GStreamer 1.28.6. Values are average frames per second.

| Pipeline | Operation | 720p (1280×720) | 1080p (1920×1080) | 4K (3840×2160) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| FFmpeg VA-API | Decode | 1111 | 806 | 297 |
| FFmpeg VA-API | Encode | 1289 | 714 | 206 |
| GStreamer VA | Decode | 1088 | 823 | 278 |
| GStreamer VA | Encode | 1285 | 709 | 206 |
| GStreamer direct V4L2 | Decode | 1199 | 882 | 330 |
| GStreamer direct V4L2 | Encode | 1287 | 724 | 210 |

Synthetic I/P streams, GOP 60, VBR at 5 / 10 / 20 Mbps respectively. Encoding
includes CPU NV12 upload; FFmpeg encoding uses **`async_depth=4`**. Decoding waits
for completed frames without CPU download or rendering. Results are three-run
means, except 4K encoding, which uses one completed run; each run processes
9,000 / 6,000 / 2,400 frames respectively. Actual performance depends on content
and pipeline configuration.

## Requirements

- Linux with the Qualcomm Iris stateful driver and MSM DRM support.
- The changes supplied in [patches/](patches/), unless already present in your
  kernel: decode-order output, larger CAPTURE pools, and encoder deblocking
  controls. The patches are references to integrate into your kernel.
- Access to the Iris video devices and DRM render node.
- A C++17 compiler, Meson ≥ 0.61, Ninja, pkg-config, and development libraries
  for libva, libdrm, EGL, GLES 3.2, and GBM.
- For VPP: system FastCV and FastRPC libraries with a working CDSP runtime.

## Build and install

The Debian package CI builds one ARM64 package on Ubuntu Noble, then checks
installation and driver loading on Debian Trixie, Ubuntu Noble, and Ubuntu
Resolute. Tag builds publish the same package and debug symbols to a draft
GitHub Release after all checks pass. Hardware codec testing is separate.

On Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel meson ninja pkgconf libva libdrm mesa libglvnd
python3 packaging/make-dist.py
cd packaging/arch
makepkg -si
```

The [PKGBUILD](packaging/arch/PKGBUILD) packages the userspace driver. After
editing packaged sources, regenerate the archive, update `sha256sums` using
`makepkg -g`, and refresh `.SRCINFO` with `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`.

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install -y build-essential debhelper meson ninja-build pkg-config \
  libva-dev libdrm-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgles-dev libgbm-dev
./build.sh
sudo apt install -y ./output/libva-v4l2_*_arm64.deb
```

`build.sh` runs `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b` and collects the packages in
`output/`.

Alternatively, build and install with Meson:

```sh
meson setup build --buildtype=release --prefix=/usr -Dlibdir=lib
meson compile -C build
sudo meson install -C build
```

FastCV VPP defaults to `-Dfastcv=disabled`. Use `-Dfastcv=auto` to enable it
when dependencies are available or `-Dfastcv=enabled` to require build dependencies.
Debian / Ubuntu packages explicitly disable FastCV for consistent distribution builds.
FastCV is loaded dynamically; missing runtime libraries disable only VPP.

Adjust `libdir` if your system uses a driver directory other than `/usr/lib/dri`.
Installation adds the MSM driver alias, so **`LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME` is not required**
on the target platform.

To check the installation (`vainfo` comes from `libva-utils` on Arch):

```sh
vainfo --display drm --device /dev/dri/renderD128
```

## Usage

Play a video with mpv:

```sh
mpv --hwdec=vaapi input.mp4
```

Encode to H.264 with FFmpeg:

```sh
ffmpeg -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 -i input.mp4 -an \
  -vf format=nv12,hwupload -c:v h264_vaapi -profile:v high \
  -bf 0 -g 60 -rc_mode CBR -b:v 6M -async_depth 4 output.mp4
```

For HEVC, use `-c:v hevc_vaapi -profile:v main` in the command above.

For hardware decoding and encoding of a supported 8-bit input:

```sh
ffmpeg -hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_device /dev/dri/renderD128 \
  -hwaccel_output_format vaapi -i input.mp4 -an \
  -c:v h264_vaapi -bf 0 -qp 24 -async_depth 4 output.mp4
```

MP4 and raw H.264 output are supported; for Matroska, encode to raw H.264 first
and remux. FFmpeg may warn about unsupported packed headers because the firmware
produces the headers. Custom VUI/SEI metadata is not forwarded.

Scale a decoded NV12 video on CDSP:

```sh
ffmpeg -hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_device /dev/dri/renderD128 \
  -hwaccel_output_format vaapi -i input.mp4 -an \
  -vf scale_vaapi=w=1920:h=1080 -c:v h264_vaapi -bf 0 -qp 24 \
  -async_depth 4 output.mp4
```

For GStreamer, set `GST_VA_ALL_DRIVERS=1` to enable this driver's `va` elements:

```sh
GST_VA_ALL_DRIVERS=1 gst-launch-1.0 -e \
  videotestsrc num-buffers=120 ! \
  video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=30/1 ! \
  vah264enc rate-control=vbr bitrate=6000 target-percentage=100 \
    b-frames=0 ref-frames=1 target-usage=1 key-int-max=60 ! \
  'video/x-h264,profile=high' ! h264parse ! mp4mux ! filesink location=output.mp4
```

For Sunshine/Moonlight, use **H.264 / SDR**. HEVC and AV1 encoder probes may fail
while H.264 remains available.

## Configuration and development

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2` | Explicitly select this backend. |
| `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=/path/to/build` | Load an uninstalled build. |
| `IRIS_VAAPI_DEVICE` / `IRIS_VAAPI_ENCODER_DEVICE` | Override automatic video-device discovery. |
| `IRIS_VAAPI_COPY=gpu` or `cpu` | Select the copy path; default is `gpu`. |
| `IRIS_VAAPI_DEBUG=1` | Enable diagnostics. |

## Rate control and quality

All VA rate-control modes are accepted. The firmware exposes fixed-QP plus
CBR/VBR controllers, so the remaining modes are emulated from those:

| VA mode | Firmware behavior |
| --- | --- |
| CQP | Fixed QP from the picture QP (`-qp`). |
| CBR | Constant bitrate controller. |
| VBR | Variable bitrate with average and peak limits. |
| QVBR | VBR with `quality_factor` as the maximum-QP ceiling. Bitrate may overshoot the target when the ceiling is hit, as VA specifies. |
| ICQ | Fixed-QP controller seeded from `ICQ_quality_factor`; the firmware has no adaptive quality mode. |
| AVBR | CBR; there is no separate average-bitrate controller or convergence window. |

VA quality levels are advertised through `VAConfigAttribEncQualityRange = 4`
and map to a maximum-QP ceiling for CBR/VBR; the firmware has no speed or
quality preset, so only the QP budget changes. CQP and ICQ name their QP
explicitly and are unaffected. Level 0 (default) leaves the range unrestricted.

| Quality level | Maximum QP |
| --- | --- |
| 1 (best) | 30 |
| 2 | 37 |
| 3 | 44 |
| 4 (fastest) | 51 |

Sunshine maps its VA-API quality setting to these levels and its rate-control
setting to the modes above.

Use clang-format 22 and the checked-in `.clang-format`. Meson provides `format`
and `format-check` targets when clang-format is available; `-Dwerror=true`
enables compiler warnings as errors. Hardware tests and their run instructions
are in [tests/](tests/). Local research and historical results live in ignored
`tmp/` and are not required to build the driver.
